# INSIGHTS

- Total Revenue and Profit: The total revenue of $85M and profit of $32M shows strong overall performance, with a profit margin of 38%. This suggests the company is maintaining healthy profitability relative to its costs.
- Product Sales: Water Bottle is the top-selling product, followed by Patch Kit & Patch, showing that smaller, essential items are popular among customers. 
Sports Helmets and AWC Logo Cap are among the top 5, suggesting that customers also value accessories and safety gear.
- Profit by Product: The Sport-100 Helmet leads in profitability with $1.2M in profit, followed by Water Bottles at $0.4M. This shows that even though Water Bottles have the highest sales, Sport Helmets deliver higher profit.
- Profit Margin by Product Category: Accessories have the highest profit margin at 59%, followed by Clothing (34%) and Bikes (33%). This means accessories, though they might not have the highest sales volume, are more cost-efficient and yield more profit per unit.
- Bikes generate the highest total profit, indicating they contribute the most to overall earnings, likely due to higher prices or larger sales volume. However, Accessories have the highest profit margin, meaning that, on a per-unit basis, they are the most profitable, even if their total sales might be lower. Clothing follows a similar pattern with a higher profit margin than bikes but lower overall profit.
- Order Quantity by Age Group: The Adults (35-64) age group accounts for the largest share of purchases (0.67M units), followed by Young Adults (25-34) at 0.44M. These two age groups represent a higher portion of the customer base and should be targeted more.
- Revenue Trends by Month: A dip in revenue is observed during the middle of the year (June to September), with a recovery towards the end. This could signal a seasonal trend or market fluctuation.
- Geographic Segmentation: The map shows customer distribution, with most sales concentrated in North America and Australia. This indicates that marketing and product outreach might need to expand into underperforming regions.
- Order Quantity by Days of the Week: The highest order quantities are seen on Saturday and Thursday, showing customer activity spikes on weekend and middle of the week, likely driven by online traffic patterns, promotional activities or just because it's the weekend, people shop more.


# RECOMMENDATIONS
- Increase Focus on Accessories: Accessories have the highest profit margin (59%). Focus on promoting these products through cross-selling with higher-value items like Bikes to boost profit without increasing costs significantly. Bikes are driving more revenue, but Accessories and Clothing are more cost-efficient, providing higher returns relative to their costs. This could suggest an opportunity to focus on increasing sales of Accessories and Clothing to boost profitability.
- Target Adult and Young Adult Age Groups: Since Adults (35-64) and Young Adults (25-34) make up the majority of the customer base, design marketing campaigns, discounts, or loyalty programs aimed at these age groups to further engage them.
- Address Revenue Dips in Mid-Year: Investigate why revenue dips between June and September. This could be a seasonal effect, but if it's due to marketing or product availability, consider promotions or new product launches in this period to maintain consistency.
- Expand Geographic Reach: The company could explore new markets beyond North America and Australia. Invest in targeted marketing campaigns or partnerships to enter new regions with growth potential, such as Europe or Asia.
- Leverage High Traffic Days: Since Monday and Thursday see the highest order activity, concentrate advertising and special offers around these days. Implement flash sales or time-sensitive promotions to capitalize on customer behavior.
- Promote Products with High Margins and Profit: Items like Sport-100 Helmet and Water Bottles are not only profitable but popular. Focus on increasing their visibility with bundled offers or discounts to drive both revenue and profit further.
  
The company can increase profitability, expand its market presence, and maintain steady revenue growth by implementing these strategies.
